# Constitution
Alpha-Omega Foundation is a growing organisation that offers peer 2 peer, open source insurance servers. It is a project by a distributed labour force from variety of disciplines to bring an old technology back to life based on its original technologies mediated by open source technological solutions. The complexity comes from lobbing and profit making approaches of insurance corporations which they haven't been questioned for centuries and we want to disrupt and fix this.
Our labour model is based on distributed computing and open source models, this approach would allow us to respond and design innovative approaches to what insurance is and what it can become?

##What does Alpha-Omega means
Alpha-Omega comes from greek alphabetical system. Alpha is the beginning and Omega the end of greek alphabetical system. They refer to beginning and end of life and creation. We want to develop a service that can cover communities beyond what is common practice. This is also a reminder that insurance practices existed for as long as we lived on this planet as a species in variety of forms, norms and practices.



##Examples
### Example 1 - Car insurance:
You want to find a car insurance for your car.
**Approach I**
1. You go to Alpha-Omega website and add some information about yourself, your needs and what matters to you
2. Alpha-Omega intelligent search engine will search across all community clusters of people and finds the relevant solutions for your needs.
3. You read the constitution and summary of a very small list and join the one that makes most sense to you.
4. Your insurance premium starts and you get live updates from your cluster about how much money you have in your cluster pot.

Your involvement and process can be as simple as this or you can go further.

You feel passionate about some social movement: for example you want to invest your insurance fund into renewable energy.

5. You can add a series of tags to your account and based on your choices and the rest of your cluster, our consensus building AI system will generate an investment portfolio for your cluster.
6. The autonomous Alpha-Omega expert system will invest your money into variety of companies and charities who are working around your investment domain.
7. You look at analytics and report about how well your cluster is doing
8. End of phase 2.
